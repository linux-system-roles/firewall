[1.4.5] - 2023-06-21
--------------------

### Bug Fixes

- fix: Don't install python(3)-firewall it's a dependency of firewalld (#148)

  Enhancement: The role now does not run tasks to install python-firewall or python3-firewall based on installed python version.
  
  Reason:  python-firewall or python3-firewall is pulled automatically by dnf and yum when installing firewalld.
  The issue is that when I install python3 on EL 7, the role then fails with "No package matching 'python3-firewall' found available, installed or updated". It sees python3 present on the system and tries to install python3-firewall, which is not available on EL 7.
  
  Result: The role doesn't fail on EL 7 when python3 is installed on the managed node.

- docs: Add note about using previous: replaced and temporary service failures (#141)

  Add a note to the README about the use of `previous: replaced` and that it can
  cause temporary service outages to the node being managed.
  https://github.com/linux-system-roles/firewall/issues/138

- docs: Consistent contributing.md for all roles - allow role specific contributing.md section (#143)

  Provide a single, consistent contributing.md for all roles.  This mostly links to
  and summarizes https://linux-system-roles.github.io/contribute.html
  
  Allow for a role specific section which typically has information about
  role particulars, role debugging tips, etc.

- ci: update tox-lsr to version 3.0.0 (#144)

  The major version bump is because tox-lsr 3 drops support
  for tox version 2.  If you are using tox 2 you will need to
  upgrade to tox 3 or 4.
  
  tox-lsr 3.0.0 adds support for tox 4, commitlint, and ansible-lint-collection
  
  See https://github.com/linux-system-roles/tox-lsr/releases/tag/3.0.0
  for full release notes

- ci: fix pylintrc issues (#145)

  Remove `no-space-check` and `overgeneral-exception`

- ci: Add pull request template and run commitlint on PR title only (#147)

  We now ensure the conventional commits format only on PR titles and not on
  commits to let developers keep commit messages targeted for other developers
  i.e. describe actual changes to code that users should not care about.
  And PR titles, on the contrary, must be aimed at end users.

    * Multiple matches will result in play being done on multiple devices

* Add Network Manager interaction when adding/removing interfaces from zones

* Add functions that convert PCI IDs into network interface names

Fixes #87

[1.3.0] - 2022-07-20
--------------------

### New Features

- Feature: add/update/delete services

    * Can add services by using the present state, with the specified details for the service (Permanent required)
    * Only required details are the service name using the service option, other options supported:
    * short, description, port, source port, protocol, module (helper_module), destination
    * remove services by using absent state and only the service name (no "detail" options) (Permanent required)
    * remove service elements by adding the elements and their values
    * service will not be removed if any of the removable elements are specified as well
    * update short and descriptions of services by using present state with the options while short or description are defined
    * Cannot remove short or descriptions
    * as with the rest of this feature, permanent is required to do this

Fixes: #80

- Feature: Ansible facts with firewalld configuration

    * called by calling the firewall system role with either no parameters
      or with only the `detailed` parameter
    * fetches and returns ansible fact `firewall_config`
    * detailed in README.md, under ansible_fact section

Fixes #82

### Bug Fixes

- bugfix: port forward dict form

    * fixed bug where port_forward argument only worked with string argument
    * additionally argument convert to list if necessary
    * minimal tests added for port forward
    * tests_port_forward.yml only has the fail case that the role fails

Fixes: #85

### Other Changes

- make all tests work with gather_facts: false (#84)

The tests_zone.yml test uses facts outside of the role and
needs to `gather_facts: true` when using ANSIBLE_GATHERING=explicit

- make min_ansible_version a string in meta/main.yml (#88)

The Ansible developers say that `min_ansible_version` in meta/main.yml
must be a `string` value like `"2.9"`, not a `float` value like `2.9`.

- fix destination rendering in github markdown renderer

Just make the problematic text a literal string so it won't get rendered incorrectly

- Add CHANGELOG.md (#90)
